[description]

This package provides a class whose instances handle editing a single poly-line (or -gon) on a
canvas. Instances can be configured with regard to the visual appearance of the markers denoting the
line's vertices, as well as if the line is to be closed or not, and further if a closed line has to
be convex or not. Note that instances do not store the edited polyline themselves, but delegate this
to a configurable object.

[section {Interaction}]

[para] The polyline editor internally uses an instance of package [package canvas::edit::points],
and inherits all the options and behaviours for it. The color options are additionally applied to
the line element of this editor

[para] Beyond that it provides 2 options to configure the editing mode, and one option to customize
the line/polygon item used to render the line through the points.

[para] The main editing mode is controlled by option [option -closed] for [term line] (i.e. open)
versus [term polygon] (i.e. closed). The default is line/open mode.

[para] In polygon/closed mode the option [option -convex] controls if the editor enforces convexity
of the polygon, or not. The default is no enforcement of convexity.

[para] The option [option -line-config] enables basic customization of the line/polygon item. Note
that it cannot overide the inherited color options.

[section {Class API}]

[list_begin definitions]
[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[call [cmd ::canvas::edit] [method polyline] [arg objectName] [arg canvas] [arg options]...]

This, the class command, creates and configures a new instance of a
polyline editor, named [arg objectName]. The instance will be
connected to the specified [arg canvas] widget.

[para] The result of the command is the fully qualified name of the
instance command.

[para] The options accepted here, and their values, are explained in
the section [sectref Options].

[list_end]

[section {Instance API}]

Instances of the polyline editors provide the following API:

[list_begin definitions]
[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[call [cmd objectName] [method destroy]]

This method destroys the polyline editor and releases all its
internal resources.

[para] Note that this operation does not destroy the items the editor
managed on the attached canvas, nor the canvas itself.

[para] The result of the method is an empty string.

[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[call [cmd objectName] [method enable]]

This method activates editing of the polyline on the canvas. This
is the default after instance creation. A call is ignored if the
editor is already active.

[para] The result of the method is an empty string.

[para] The complementary method is [method disable]. The interogatory
method for the current state is [method active].

[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[call [cmd objectName] [method disable]]

This method disables editing of the polyline on the canvas. A call
is ignored if the editor is already disabled.

[para] The result of the method is an empty string.

[para] The complementary method is [method enable]. The interogatory
method for the current state is [method active].

[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[call [cmd objectName] [method active]]

This method queries the editor state.

[para] The result of the method is a boolean value, [const true] if
the editor is active, and [const false] otherwise, i.e. disabled.

[para] The methods to change the state are [method enable] and
[method disable].

[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[call [cmd objectName] [method add] [arg x] [arg y]]

This method programmatically adds a vertex at the specified location to the line.

[para] The result of the method is an empty string.

[para] Note that this method goes through the whole set of callbacks
invoked when the user interactively creates a vertex, i.e.
[option -create-cmd], and, more importantly, [option -data-cmd].

[para] One important difference however. The new vertex is always added
at the end of the line, whereas interactive creation uses heuristics
to splice it into the line at a suitable location.

[para] This is the method through which to load the vertices of a
pre-existing line into an editor instance.

[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[call [cmd objectName] [method clear]]

This method programmatically removes all vertices from the editor,
essentially removing the whole line.

[para] The result of the method is an empty string.

[para] Note that this method goes through the same callbacks invoked
when the user interactively removes a vertex, i.e. [option -data-cmd].

[list_end]

[section Options]

The class command accepts the following options

[list_begin options]

[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[opt_def -active-cmd [arg command-prefix]]

The value of this option is a command prefix the editor will invoke
when the mouse enters or leaves the line or a point managed by the instance.

[para] If not specified it defaults to an empty command which does nothing.

[para] The signature of this command prefix is

[list_begin definitions]
[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[call [cmd activeCmd] [arg editorObj] [arg id]]

[para] The [arg id] identifies the entered object.

[para] An empty [arg id] indicates that the last entered object was left.

[para] The value [const line] indicates that the line was entered.

[para] A numeric value [var N] indicates that the [var N]'th vertex of the line was entered,
counting from [const 0].

[para] The result of this method is ignored.

[list_end]

[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[opt_def -add-remove-point [arg eventspec]]

The value of this option is an event specification (without bracketing angles) declaring which event
will trigger adding and removing a point.

[para] This option can only be set at construction time.

[para] The default setup uses different events for adding and removing points, [const ButtonPress-1]
and [const ButtonPress-2] respectively.

[para] When using this option the same event is used for both operations. This is no problem because
adding is bound as canvas-global event while removal is bound to the relevant canvas items.

[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[opt_def -closed [arg boolean]]

The value of this option is a boolean flag indicating if the edited polyline is closed, i.e. a loop,
or not. [strong NOTE] that a proper loop requires at least 3 points. For less than that an open line
is shown, or even just a point.

[para] This option can only be set at construction time.

[para] If not specified it defaults to [const false]

[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[opt_def -color [arg colorspec]]

The value of this option is the fill color for the default item created when adding a point, and no
[option -create-cmd] is specified.

[para] The default value is [const SkyBlue2].

[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[opt_def -convex [arg boolean]]

The value of this option is a boolean flag indicating if the edited polyline is strictly convex, or
not.

This option has meaning if and only if option [option -closed] is configured to be [const true].

[para] This option can only be set at construction time.

[para] If not specified it defaults to [const false]

[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[opt_def -create-cmd [arg command-prefix]]

The value of this option is a command prefix the editor will invoke
when it has to create a new vertex.

[para] While this option can be set after construction, it is recommended to use this feature only
as a means of inserting custom processing to be done at creation time which remembers and calls the
previous value of the option.

[para] If not specified it defaults to a command which will create a
black-bordered blue circle of radius 3 centered on the location of the
new point.

[para] The signature of this command prefix is

[list_begin definitions]
[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[call [cmd createCmd] [arg canvas] [arg x] [arg y]]

The result of the command prefix [emph must] be a list of the canvas
items it created to represent the marker. Note here that the visual
representation of a "vertex" may consist of multiple canvas items in
an arbitrary shape.

[para] The returned list of items is allowed to be empty, and such is
taken as signal that the callback vetoed the creation of the vertex.

[list_end]

[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[opt_def -data-cmd [arg command-prefix]]

The value of this option is a command prefix the editor will invoke
when the line was edited in some way (vertex added, removed,
moved). This is how the editor delegates the actual storage of the
line information to an outside object.

[para] This option can only be set at construction time.

[para] If not specified it defaults to an empty string and is ignored
by the editor, i.e. not invoked.

[para] The signature of this command prefix is

[list_begin definitions]
[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[call [cmd dataCmd] [arg editorObj] [arg coordinates]]

This callback is invoked when the line was changed either interactively,
or programmatically.

See instance method [method add] for the latter.

[para] The [arg editorObj] identifies the instance invoking the
callback, whereas [arg coordinates] is a list of vertex locations,
with each location a pair of x- and y-coordinates.

[para] The result of this method is ignored.

[list_end][comment callback-signatures]

[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[opt_def -drag-point [arg eventspec]]

The value of this option is an event specification (without bracketing angles) declaring which event
will trigger a drag action on points.

[para] This option can only be set at construction time.

[para] The default specification is [const ButtonPress-3].

[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[opt_def -hilit-color [arg colorspec]]

The value of this option is the highlight color for the default item created when adding a point,
and no [option -highlight-cmd] is specified.

[para] The default value is [const red].

[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[opt_def -kind [arg name]]

The value of this option is the canvas item type for the default item created when adding a point,
and no [option -create-cmd] is specified.

Only item types specified through a bounding box are suitable.

[para] The default value is [const oval].

[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[opt_def -line-config [arg list]]

The value of this option is a list of options and their values to be applied to the internal
line/polygon item whenever it is regenerated after changes.

Note that these options [strong cannot] override the principal coloring of the line/polygon as
applied by the main options [option -color] and [option -hilit-color].

[para] If not specified it defaults to the empty list.

[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[opt_def -radius [arg int]]

The value of this option is the radius for the default item created when adding a point,
and no [option -create-cmd] is specified.

[para] The default value is [const 3].

[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[comment {= = == === ===== ======== ============= =====================}]
[opt_def -tag [arg string]]

The value of this option is the name of the canvas tag with which to
identify all items of all vertices managed by the editor.

[para] This option can only be set at construction time.

[para] If not specified it defaults to [const POLYLINE]
